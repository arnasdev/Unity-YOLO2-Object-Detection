Unity-YOLO2-Object-Detection

This repository contains a Unity project which is good as of version 2018.1. The project implements YOLO2 (as seen in http://www.died.tw/2018/01/c-opencvsharp-dnn-with-yolo2.html , so thanks to Died Liu for the OpenCVSharp YOLO2 implementation, I merely changed the code for Unity usage)

The yolo2 .weights file is missing as github doesn't support files over 100mb, and can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yJIMTK8n8YN-bD4ahEa22ojZXllzaI2c/view?usp=sharing , place it in the root folder alongside the .cfg file
